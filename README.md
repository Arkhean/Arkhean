### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Backend WEB / API developer at TEHTRIS.

- Python
- SQL
- Docker

You'll see here some of my projects made during school (ENSEIRB-MATMECA) in C/C++ or JavaScript such as games, machine learning algorithms or even a mobile application written in React native !

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and WEB development with Python, but I am learning a bit about Rust lately.
